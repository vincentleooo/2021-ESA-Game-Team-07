This is the deliverable for the Engineering Systems Architecture module in SUTD. A made-from-scratch board game!

### Walkthrough
This will be coming as soon as I fix the game database server issues.

### To-Do
- [ ] Migrate database functionality from the shut down AWS server to another server.
- [ ] Refactor and optimise the game.
- [ ] Find somewhere to host the game (rshiny.io seems to be pretty slow).
